1) The results from the insert function take 1.07 seconds
where as the append function takes 3.04 mili seconds.

    197.2   |     177.5    medium array
    51      |     101.2    small array
    38.8    |     93.2     tiny array
        

In the beginning the timing of the functions are not too off from each other. 
however, we can see that as the size of the arrays passed in increases, the functions space time
become vastly different. insert starts out small, but increases an insane amount compared to the append function.

The append function is obviously significantly faster when given a huge value. Why is that?
Because .unshift adds to the beginning of an array, while .push adds to the end. If something is added to 
the end it won't need to shift the indexes of the entire array because it simply just 
adds it on to the end. However, in the case of unshift this is true since the number in this 
case is being added to the beginning of the index. So it hast to shift everything else over.
